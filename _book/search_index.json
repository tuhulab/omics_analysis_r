Why should we do an omics data analysis? Usually it’s not for fun, though it indeed has a lot of fun. Scientific studies usually aim to test a hypothesis, or generate new hypotheses. Usually it’s a combination of both. That is to test a hypothesis, meanwhile to generate new hypotheses. Depending on the hypothesis to test or generate, we need different data to answer. Data quality check and cleaning Data processing. Sometimes, you need Supercomputerome, such as (Computerome) Exploratory data analysis and modelling Visualization and reporting. Exercise: Find out what is Computerome Which step(s) of omics data analysis is less familiar to you, and which may be a challenge for you? 3.1.2 Getting started with R 3.1.2.1 R and RStudio 3.1.2.2 CRAN and Bioconductor R package repository. For each distribution and dependency (compatibility) management CRAN vs. Bioconductor CRAN: R core team; general purpose statistics Bioconductor: reviewed; for biology 3.1.3 Statistics 3.1.3.1 Why do we need statistics? 3.1.3.2 Classification and regression 3.2 Day 2 3.2.1 Recap What is reproducibility in omics data analysis? Which factors could affect reproducibility?
