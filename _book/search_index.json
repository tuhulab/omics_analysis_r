Why should we do an omics data analysis? Usually it’s not for fun, though it indeed has a lot of fun. Scientific studies usually aim to test a hypothesis, or generate new hypotheses. Usually it’s a combination of both. That is to test a hypothesis, meanwhile to generate new hypotheses. Depending on the hypothesis to test or generate, we need different data to answer. Data quality check and cleaning Data processing. Sometimes, you need Supercomputerome, such as (Computerome) Exploratory data analysis and modelling Visualization and reporting.
