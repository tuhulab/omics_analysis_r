Why should we do an omics data analysis? Usually it’s not for fun, though it indeed has a lot of fun. Scientific studies usually aim to test a hypothesis, or generate new hypotheses. Usually it’s a combination of both. That is to test a hypothesis, meanwhile to generate new hypotheses. Depending on the hypothesis to test or generate, we need different data to answer. Data quality check and cleaning Data processing. Sometimes, you need Supercomputerome, such as (Computerome) Exploratory data analysis and modelling Visualization and reporting. Exercise: Find out what is Computerome Which step(s) of omics data analysis is less familiar to you, and which may be a challenge for you? 2.1.2 Getting started with R 2.1.2.1 R and RStudio 2.1.2.2 CRAN and Bioconductor R package repository. For each distribution and dependency (compatibility) management CRAN vs. Bioconductor CRAN: R core team; general purpose statistics Bioconductor: reviewed; for biology 2.1.3 Statistics 2.1.3.1 Why do we need statistics? 2.1.3.2 Classification and regression 2.2 Day 2 2.2.1 Recap What is reproducibility in omics data analysis? Which factors could affect reproducibility? R and RStudio CRAN and Bioconductor 2.2.2 R: loading a package, and get help library and package. library(gprofiler2) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) 2.2.3 R: the basics 2.2.3.1 Arithmatic operation 2 + 3 * 5 # Note the order of operations. (2 + 3) * 5 log(10) # Natural logarithm with base e 5^2 # 5 raised to the second power 3/2 # Division sqrt(16) # Square root abs(3-7) # Absolute value of 3-7 pi # The number exp(2) # exponential function 28%%6 # Modulo Exercise: Calculate 86 plus 56 13 minus 93 71 times 152 the average of 45 and 40 the sum of 182 and 123 the difference between 190 and 24 the ratio between 198 and 176 26 multiply 151 Execute log(45) and log2(45) and compare the difference. Note: you can get help using help(log) and help(log2) A gene expression: CO (mean: 12) TRET (mean: 50) upregulated; Log2 fold change: 2.0588937 B gene expression: CO (mean: 50) TEAT (mean: 12) downregulated; Log2 fold change: -2.0588937 log computes logarithms, by default natural logarithms, log10 computes common (i.e., base 10) logarithms, and log2 computes binary (i.e., base 2) logarithms. The general form log(x, base) computes logarithms with base base. 2.2.3.2 Variable assignment # Assign the value 42 to x x &lt;- 42 # Print out the value of the variable x x # Assign the value 5 to the variable my_apples my_apples &lt;- 5 # Print out the value of the variable my_apples my_apples # Assign a value to the variables my_apples and my_oranges my_apples &lt;- 5 my_oranges &lt;- 6 # Add these two variables together my_apples + my_oranges # Create the variable my_fruit my_fruit &lt;- my_apples + my_oranges 2.2.3.3 Variable type # Change my_numeric to be 42 my_numeric &lt;- 42 # Change my_character to be &quot;universe&quot; my_character &lt;- &quot;universe&quot; # Change my_logical to be FALSE my_logical &lt;- FALSE # Check class of my_numeric class(my_numeric) # Check class of my_character class(my_character) # Check class of my_logical class(my_logical) logic_1 &lt;- TRUE logic_2 &lt;- &quot;TRUE&quot; logic_3 &lt;- &quot;True&quot; 2 == 3 ## [1] FALSE logic_1 == logic_2 ## [1] TRUE logic_2 == logic_3 ## [1] FALSE logic_1 == logic_3 ## [1] FALSE logic_1 == 1 ## [1] TRUE 1 &lt; 2 ## [1] TRUE 1 &gt; 2 ## [1] FALSE 1 == 2 ## [1] FALSE 1 != 2 # (not equal to) ## [1] TRUE 2.2.3.4 vector # Define the variable vegas vegas &lt;- &quot;Go!&quot; numeric_vector &lt;- c(1, 10, 49) character_vector &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) # Complete the code for boolean_vector boolean_vector &lt;-c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE) # Poker winnings from Monday to Friday poker_vector &lt;- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240) # Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday roulette_vector &lt;- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10) # Assign days as names of poker_vector names(poker_vector) &lt;- c(&quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Thursday&quot;, &quot;Friday&quot;) # Assign days as names of roulette_vector names(roulette_vector)&lt;-c(&quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Thursday&quot;, &quot;Friday&quot;) A_vector &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) B_vector &lt;- c(4, 5, 6) # Take the sum of A_vector and B_vector total_vector &lt;- A_vector + B_vector C_vector &lt;- c(A_vector, A_vector) D_vector &lt;- c(A_vector, B_vector) A_vector * B_vector A_vector + 1 Recap variable class: numeric, character, logical "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
