The reason for a new book is because, omics data analysis requires a wide range of knowledge and skills, including biology, omics, statistics, bioinformatics, and programming etc. These knowledge spreads in many textbooks, websites, and blogs. For a biologist without prior knowledge or exposure to these topics, such as my wife who graduates her master in biomedicine, the learning curve could be very steady if without guidance. I decide first to start this book as teaching notes, documenting my teaching materials each day. Then, I plan to consolidate them into separate themes: R programming, biology, bioinformatics etc. I assume the audience has (or is studying for) a bachelor degree in science. Therefore, the book starts from very basics. 1.2 Acknowledgement I thank my wife (and student) Jingyao who is always challenging herself. When I write this book, I shamelessly “borrowed” a lot of contents from HOLMES and Huber (2018), Akalin (2020).
